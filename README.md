Before dive into the neural search engines, will look in to regular **keyword-based searching**
## What is a Keyword-based searching

The most straight forward way of searching is keyword-based searching. What it does is matching the query with the keywords which we have and output the results. But this approach is brital as there are multiple way of describing the same thing. Other drawback of this approach is the **polysemy** which means that the same word can mean multiple things.
Back in 2015 tech giant Google launched **RankBrain** which combines AI to bring a revolution in keyword-based search. 

#### Before RankBrain process was something like this.

#### After Introducing RankBrain

So what RankBrain does,
- Depend on the keyword RankBrain will increase or decrease the importance of backlinks, content refreshes, domain authority etc.
- Then, it looks at how Google searchers interact with the new search results. If users like the new algorithm better, it stays. If not, RankBrain rolls back the old algorithm.

But since data becoming growing exponentially and people wanted to search through voice, images, vedios and interact with voice assistance like siri, cortana, and alexa, engineers wanted to apply AI and Deep Learning techniques in order to achieve these use cases. Thats where the neural search comes in to the picture.
